### 🧠 1. *“Teach Me Something New” — The Beginner Learner*
**Scenario:**  
Lina is 22, living alone for the first time. She’s always wanted to cook something real, not just instant noodles.  
She opens Step Chef, types *“pasta”*, and the app suggests *“Spaghetti Carbonara”* with a friendly line:  
> “A perfect first date meal — let’s make it easy.”  

Step Chef breaks the dish into six short steps, each under 5 minutes.  
When Lina finishes, the app says:  
> “You just mastered your first Italian dish! 🍝”  

She feels accomplished, saves it as *Learned*, and later tells a friend: “This app actually taught me how to cook!”
